	Abstract = {A completely well-centered tetrahedral mesh is a
                  triangulation of a three dimensional domain in which
                  every tetrahedron and every triangle contains its
                  circumcenter in its interior. Such meshes have
                  applications in scientific computing and other
                  fields. We show how to triangulate simple domains
                  using completely well-centered tetrahedra. The
                  domains we consider here are space, infinite slab,
                  infinite rectangular prism, cube, and regular
                  tetrahedron. We also demonstrate single tetrahedra
                  with various combinations of the properties of
                  dihedral acuteness, 2-well-centeredness, and
                  3-well-centeredness.},

@article{Tardos1986,
	Abstract = {Khachiyan, and recently Karmarkar, gave polynomial
                  algorithms to solve the linear programming
                  problem. These algorithms have a small theoretical
                  drawback; namely, the number of arithmetic steps
                  depends on the size of the input numbers. We present
                  a polynomial linear programming algorithm whose
                  number of arithmetic steps depends only on the size
                  of the numbers in the constraint matrix, but is
                  independent of the size of the numbers in the
                  right-hand side and objective vectors. In
                  particular, it gives a polynomial algorithm for the
                  minimum cost flow and multicommodity flow problems
                  in which the number of arithmetic steps is
                  independent of the size of the costs and
                  capacities. The algorithm makes use of an existing
                  polynomial linear programming algorithm. The problem
                  of whether any algorithm has a running time that is
                  independent even of the size of the numbers in the
                  constraint matrix remains

                  been an important issue in linear programming,

                  an important issue in IPMs. However, the

                  this paper, we survey the various theoretical and

@book{KaMiMr2004,
    abstract = {Homology is a powerful tool used by mathematicians to
                  study the properties of spaces and maps that are
                  insensitive to small perturbations. This book uses a
                  computer to develop a combinatorial computational
                  approach to the subject. The core of the book deals
                  with homology theory and its computation. Following
                  this is a section containing extensions to further
                  developments in algebraic topology, applications
                  to computational dynamics, and applications to image
                  processing. Included are exercises and software that
                  can be used to compute homology groups and maps. The
                  book will appeal to researchers and graduate
                  students in mathematics, computer science,
                  engineering, and nonlinear dynamics.},

Let P be a matrix property that is defined for the matrices over GF(2) or GF(3), and that is maintained under submatrix taking, row and column permutations, scaling, and pivots, and when a row or column unit vector is adjoined. We propose a general matroid-based technique for investigating the minimal violation matrices of P.
The problem of understanding these matrices is converted to a matroid problem involving a certain class of matroids that is closed under the taking of minors. Each matroid of the class has its elements labelled in a novel way. The use of these labels is crucial for the efficacy of the overall approach.
We apply the method to the case where P is the property of regularity (a binary matrix is regular if it can be signed to become a totally unimodular real matrix). The method yields surprisingly simple and complete constructions for the following matrix classes, for which to-date no complete construction other than enumeration has been known: The minimal nonregular binary matrices, the minimal violation matrices of total unimodularity, the complement totally unimodular matrices, and the ternary matrices that are almost binary. In addition we construct a large subclass of balanced matrices none of which is totally unimodular."

   matrix obtained from A by setting to zero any subset of its entries
   is totally unimodular. Restricted unimodular matrices are also
   known as matrices without odd cycles. They have been studied by
   Commoner and recently Yannakakis has given a polynomial algorithm
   to recognize when a matrix belongs to this class. A matrix A is
   strongly unimodular if any matrix obtained from A by setting at
   most one of its entries to zero is totally unimodular. Crama et
   al. have shown that (0,1) matrix A is strongly unimodular if and
   only if any basis of ( A, 1 ) is triangular, where I is an identity
   matrix of suitable dimensions. In this paper we give a very simple
   algorithm to test whether a matrix is restricted unimodular and we
   show that all strongly unimodular matrices can be obtained by
   composing restricted unimodular matrices with a simple operation.},

    abstract = {{We consider coverage problems in sensor networks of
                  stationary nodes with minimal geometric data. In
                  particular, there are no coordinates and no
                  localization of nodes. We introduce a new technique
                  for detecting holes in coverage by means of
                  homology, an algebraic topological invariant. The
                  impetus for these techniques is a completion of
                  network communication graphs to two types of
                  simplicial complexes: the nerve complex and the Rips
                  complex. The former gives information about coverage
                  intersection of individual sensor nodes, and is very
                  difficult to compute. The latter captures
                  connectivity in terms of inter-node communication:
                  it is easy to compute but does not in itself yield
                  coverage data. We obtain coverage data by using
                  persistence of homology classes for Rips
                  complexes. These homological invariants are
                  computable: we provide simulation results.}},

    abstract = {<p>Tunnels and channels facilitate the transport of
                  small molecules, ions and water solvent in a large
                  variety of proteins. Characteristics of individual
                  transport pathways, including their geometry,
                  physico-chemical properties and dynamics are
                  instrumental for understanding of structure-function
                  relationships of these proteins, for the design of
                  new inhibitors and construction of improved
                  biocatalysts. CAVER is a software tool widely used
                  for the identification and characterization of
                  transport pathways in static macromolecular
                  structures. Herein we present a new version of CAVER
                  enabling automatic analysis of tunnels and channels
                  in large ensembles of protein conformations. CAVER
                  3.0 implements new algorithms for the calculation
                  and clustering of pathways. A trajectory from a
                  molecular dynamics simulation serves as the typical
                  input, while detailed characteristics and summary
                  statistics of the time evolution of individual
                  pathways are provided in the outputs. To illustrate
                  the capabilities of CAVER 3.0, the tool was applied
                  for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulation of
                  the microbial enzyme haloalkane dehalogenase
                  DhaA. CAVER 3.0 safely identified and reliably
                  estimated the importance of all previously published
                  DhaA tunnels, including the tunnels closed in DhaA
                  crystal structures. Obtained results clearly
                  demonstrate that analysis of molecular dynamics
                  simulation is essential for the estimation of
                  pathway characteristics and elucidation of the
                  structural basis of the tunnel gating. CAVER 3.0
                  paves the way for the study of important biochemical
                  phenomena in the area of molecular transport,
                  molecular recognition and enzymatic catalysis. The

                  variables in large data sets is increasingly
                  important. Here, we present a measure of dependence
                  for two-variable relationships: the maximal
                  information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide
                  range of associations both functional and not, and
                  for functional relationships provides a score that
                  roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2)
                  of the data relative to the regression function. MIC
                  belongs to a larger class of maximal

                  statistics for identifying and classifying

                  descriptions of high dimensional data sets in the
                  form of simplicial complexes. Our method, called
                  Mapper, is based on the idea of partial clustering
                  of the data guided by a set of functions defined on
                  the data. The proposed method is not dependent on
                  any particular clustering algorithm, i.e. any
                  clustering algorithm may be used with Mapper. We
                  implement this method and present a few sample
                  applications in which simple descriptions of the
                  data present important information about its
                  structure.}

We propose a natural extension of Fréchet distance to more general metric spaces, which requires the leash itself to move continuously over time. For example, for curves in the punctured plane, the leash cannot pass through or jump over the obstacles (“trees”). We describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the homotopic Fréchet distance between two given polygonal curves in the plane minus a given set of polygonal obstacles."

Among the applications of this result is a stable notion of robustness for fixed points of continuous mappings and a statement of stability for contours of smooth mappings.",

abstract = "Abstract The efficiency of extracting topological information from point data depends largely on the complex that is built on top of the data points. From a computational viewpoint, the favored complexes for this purpose have so far been Vietoris–Rips and witness complexes. While the Vietoris–Rips complex is simple to compute and is a good vehicle for extracting topology of sampled spaces, its size becomes prohibitively large for reasonable computations. The witness complex on the other hand enjoys a smaller size because of a subsampling, but fails to capture the topology in high dimensions unless imposed with extra structure. We investigate a complex called the graph induced complex that, to some extent, enjoys the advantages of both. It works on a subsample but still retains the power of capturing the topology as the Vietoris–Rips complex. It only needs a graph connecting the original sample points from which it builds a complex on the subsample thus taming the size considerably. We show that, using the graph induced complex one can (i) infer the one dimensional homology of a manifold from a lean subsample, (ii) reconstruct a surface in three dimensions from a sparse subsample without computing Delaunay triangulations, (iii) infer the persistent homology groups of compact sets from a sufficiently dense sample. We provide experimental evidences in support of our theory.",

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.}},

abstract="In this paper we suggest new scaling algorithms for the assignment and minimum mean cycle problems. Our assignment algorithm is based on applying scaling to a hybrid version of the recentauction algorithm of Bertsekas and the successive shortest path algorithm. The algorithm proceeds by relaxing the optimality conditions, and the amount of relaxation is successively reduced to zero. On a network with 2n nodes,m arcs, and integer arc costs bounded byC, the algorithm runs in O(                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt n {\$}{\$}                m log(nC)) time and uses very simple data structures. This time bound is comparable to the time taken by Gabow and Tarjan's scaling algorithm, and is better than all other time bounds under thesimilarity assumption, i.e.,C = O(n                  k                ) for somek. We next consider the minimum mean cycle problem. Themean cost of a cycle is defined as the cost of the cycle divided by the number of arcs it contains. Theminimum mean cycle problem is to identify a cycle whose mean cost is minimum. We show that by using ideas of the assignment algorithm in an approximate binary search procedure, the minimum mean cycle problem can also be solved in O(                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt n {\$}{\$}                m lognC) time. Under the similarity assumption, this is the best available time bound to solve the minimum mean cycle problem.",

abstract="We investigate the properties of a metric between two distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for content-based image retrieval. The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.",

abstract="We propose a general technique for extracting a larger set of stable information from persistent homology computations than is currently done. The persistent homology algorithm is usually viewed as a procedure which starts with a filtered complex and ends with a persistence diagram. This procedure is stable (at least to certain types of perturbations of the input). This justifies the use of the diagram as a signature of the input, and the use of features derived from it in statistics and machine learning. However, these computations also produce other information of great interest to practitioners that is unfortunately unstable. For example, each point in the diagram corresponds to a simplex whose addition in the filtration results in the birth of the corresponding persistent homology class, but this correspondence is unstable. In addition, the persistence diagram is not stable with respect to other procedures that are employed in practice, such as thresholding a point cloud by density. We recast these problems as real-valued functions which are discontinuous but measurable, and then observe that convolving such a function with a suitable function produces a Lipschitz function. The resulting stable function can be estimated by perturbing the input and averaging the output. We illustrate this approach with a number of examples, including a stable localization of a persistent homology generator from brain imaging data.",

abstract="The Hausdorff distance is a very natural and straightforwarddistance measure for comparing geometric shapeslike curves or other compact sets. Unfortunately, it is not an appropriatedistance measure in some cases. For this reason, the Fr{\'e}chet distance has beeninvestigated for measuring the resemblance of geometric shapes which avoids thedrawbacks of the Hausdorff distance. Unfortunately, it is much harder to compute.Here we investigate under which conditions the two distance measuresapproximately coincide, i.e., the pathological cases for the Hausdorffdistance cannot occur. We show that for closed convex curves both distancemeasures are the same. Furthermore, they are within a constant factor ofeach other for so-called $\kappa$-straight curves, i.e., curves where thearc length between any two points onthe curve is at most a constant $\kappa$ times their Euclidean distance.Therefore, algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance can be used in thesecases to get exact or approximate computations of the Fr{\'e}chet distance, as well.",

This statistic is a collection of persistence diagrams—multiscale topological summaries used extensively in topological data analysis. We use the PHT to represent shapes and execute operations such as computing distances between shapes or classifying shapes. We provide a constructive proof that the map from the space of simplicial complexes in \\$\\{\\mathbb \\{ R\\}\\}^3\\$ into the space spanned by this statistic is injective. This implies that we can use it to determine a metric on the space of piecewise linear shapes. Stability results justify that we can approximate this metric using finitely many persistence diagrams. We illustrate the utility of this statistic on simulated and real data.}",
