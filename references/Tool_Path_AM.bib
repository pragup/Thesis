abstract="We prove the optimal convergence estimate for first-order interpolants used in finite element methods based on three major approaches for generalizing barycentric interpolation functions to convex planar polygonal domains. The Wachspress approach explicitly constructs rational functions, the Sibson approach uses Voronoi diagrams on the vertices of the polygon to define the functions, and the Harmonic approach defines the functions as the solution of a PDE. We show that given certain conditions on the geometry of the polygon, each of these constructions can obtain the optimal convergence estimate. In particular, we show that the well-known maximum interior angle condition required for interpolants over triangles is still required for Wachspress functions but not for Sibson functions.",

The approaches for global strip filling and local path searching driven by sensory data procedures are developed. A computer graphic simulation is used to verify the filling strategy available. The research was developed from the program for the design of a robot lawn mower. However, the solution appears generic. The significance is that a problem of wide application and generic solutions for general autonomous mobile robots have been developed.}

abstract = {Skeletons are powerful geometric abstractions that provide useful representations for a number of geometric operations. The straight skeleton has a lower combinatorial complexity compared with the medial axis. Moreover, while the medial axis of a polyhedron is composed of quadric surfaces the straight skeleton just consist of planar faces. Although there exist several methods to compute the straight skeleton of a polygon, the straight skeleton of polyhedra has been paid much less attention. We require to compute the skeleton of very large datasets storing orthogonal polyhedra. Furthermore, we need to treat geometric degeneracies that usually arise when dealing with orthogonal polyhedra. We present a new approach so as to robustly compute the straight skeleton of orthogonal polyhedra. We follow a geometric technique that works directly with the boundary of an orthogonal polyhedron. Our approach is output sensitive with respect to the number of vertices of the skeleton and solves geometric degeneracies. Unlike the existing straight skeleton algorithms that shrink the object boundary to obtain the skeleton, our algorithm relies on the plane sweep paradigm. The resulting skeleton is only composed of axis-aligned and 45° rotated planar faces and edges.}

abstract="Let {\$}{\$}{\{}P{\backslash}subset{\backslash}mathbb{\{}R{\}}^{\{}2{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}P⊂R2be a set of n points, of which k lie in the interior of the convex hull CH(P) of P. Let us call a triangulation T of P even (odd) if and only if all its vertices have even (odd) degree, and pseudo-even (pseudo-odd) if at least the k interior vertices have even (odd) degree. On the one hand, triangulations having all its interior vertices of even degree have one nice property; their vertices can be 3-colored, see (Heawood in Quart J Pure Math 29:270--285, 1898, Steinberg in A source book for challenges and directions, vol 55. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp 211--248, 1993, Diks et al. in Lecture notes in computer science, vol 2573. Springer, Berlin, pp 138--149, 2002). On the other hand, odd triangulations have recently found an application in the colored version of the classic ``Happy Ending Problem'' of Erd{\H{o}}s and Szekeres, see (Aichholzer et al. in SIAM J Discrete Math 23(4):2147--2155, 2010). It is easy to prove that there are sets of points that admit neither pseudo-even nor pseudo-odd triangulations. In this paper we show nonetheless how to construct a set of Steiner points S = S(P) of size at most {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}frac{\{}k{\}}{\{}3{\}} + c{\}}{\$}{\$}k3+c, where c is a positive constant, such that a pseudo-even (pseudo-odd) triangulation can be constructed on {\$}{\$}{\{}P {\backslash}cup S{\}}{\$}{\$}P∪S. Moreover, we also show that even (odd) triangulations can always be constructed using at most {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}frac{\{}n{\}}{\{}3{\}} + c{\}}{\$}{\$}n3+cSteiner points, where again c is a positive constant. Our constructions have the property that all but at most two Steiner points lie in the interior of CH(P).",

abstract="Let S be a set of n points in general position in the plane. Together with S we are given a set of parity constraints, that is, every point of S is labeled either even or odd. A graph G on S satisfies the parity constraint of a point {\$}{\$}{\{}p{\backslash}in S{\}}{\$}{\$}if the parity of the degree of p in G matches its label. In this paper, we study how well various classes of planar graphs can satisfy arbitrary parity constraints. Specifically, we show that we can always find a plane tree, a two-connected outerplanar graph, or a pointed pseudo-triangulation that satisfy all but at most three parity constraints. For triangulations we can satisfy about 2/3 of the parity constraints and we show that in the worst case there is a linear number of constraints that cannot be fulfilled. In addition, we prove that for a given simple polygon H with polygonal holes on S, it is NP-complete to decide whether there exists a triangulation of H that satisfies all parity constraints.",

This paper investigates the potential of additively manufactured lattice structures for the application of tailored impact absorption specifically for conformal body protection. It explores lattice cell types based on foam microstructures and assesses their suitability for impact absorption. The effect of varying the cell strut edge design is also investigated. The implications of scaling these cells up for AM are discussed as well as the design issues regarding the handling of geometric complexity and the requirement for body conformity. The suitability of AM materials for this application is also discussed.}

Ye, A weak Galerkin mixed finite element method for second-order elliptic problems, Math Comp 83 (2014), 2101–2126), a set of shape regularity conditions has been proposed, which allows one to prove important inequalities such as the trace inequality, the inverse inequality, and the approximation property of the L2 projection on general polygonal/polyhedral meshes. In this article, we propose a simplified set of conditions which provides similar mesh properties. Our set of conditions has two advantages. First, it allows the existence of “small” edges/faces, as long as the shape of the polygon/polyhedron is regular. Second, coupled with an extra condition, we are now able to deal with nonquasiuniform meshes. As an example, we show that the discontinuous Galerkin method for Laplacian equations on arbitrarily shaped polygonal/polyhedral meshes, satisfying the proposed set of shape regularity conditions, achieves optimal rate of convergence. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The method is presented as a generalization of a recursive bicubic B-spline patch subdivision algorithm. For rectangular control-point meshes, the method generates a standard B-spline surface. For non-rectangular meshes, it generates surfaces that are shown to reduce to a standard B-spline surface except at a small number of points, called extraordinary points. Therefore, everywhere except at these points the surface is continuous in tangent and curvature. At the extraordinary points, the pictures of the surface indicate that the surface is at least continuous in tangent, but no proof of continuity is given. A similar algorithm for biquadratic B-splines is also presented."

	abstract = "Notwithstanding the widespread use and large number of advantages over traditional subtractive manufacturing techniques, the application of additive manufacturing technologies is currently limited by the undesirable fabricating efficiency, which has attracted attentions from a wide range of areas, such as fabrication method, material improvement, and algorithm optimization. As a critical step in the process planning of additive manufacturing, path planning plays a significant role in affecting the build time by means of determining the paths for the printing head's movement. So a novel path filling pattern for the deposition of extrusion–based additive manufacturing is developed in this paper, mainly to avoid the retraction during the deposition process, and hence the time moving along these retracting paths can be saved and the discontinuous deposition can be avoided as well. On the basis of analysis and discussion of the reason behind the occurrence of retraction in the deposition process, a path planning strategy called “go and back” is presented to avoid the retraction issue. The “go and back” strategy can be adopted to generate a continuous extruder path for simple areas with the start point being connected to the end point. So a sliced layer can be decomposed into several simple areas and the sub-paths for each area are generated based on the proposed strategy. All of these obtainable sub-paths can be connected into a continuous path with proper selection of the start point. By doing this, separated sub-paths are joined with each other to decrease the number of the startup and shutdown process for the extruder, which is beneficial for the enhancement of the deposition quality and the efficiency. Additionally, some methodologies are proposed to further optimize the generated non-retraction paths. At last, several cases are used to test and verify the developed methodology and the comparisons with conventional path filling patterns are conducted. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the retraction motions and is especially beneficial for the high efficient additive manufacturing without compromise on the part resistance."

We present a variety of algorithmic and combinatorial results on this problem. In particular, we show that any finite set of at least five points allows a “pseudoconvex” tour (i.e., a tour where all angles are nonnegative), and we derive a fast algorithm for constructing such a tour. Moreover, we give a complete classification (from the computational complexity point of view) for the special cases where the tour has to be part of the orthogonal grid."

abstract = "The fabrication flexibility of 3D printing has sparked a lot of interest in designing structures with spatially graded material properties. In this paper, we propose a new type of density graded structure that is particularly designed for 3D printing systems based on filament extrusion. In order to ensure high-quality fabrication results, extrusion-based 3D printing requires not only that the structures are self-supporting, but also that extrusion toolpaths are continuous and free of self-overlap. The structure proposed in this paper, called CrossFill, complies with these requirements. In particular, CrossFill is a self-supporting foam structure, for which each layer is fabricated by a single, continuous and overlap-free path of material extrusion. Our method for generating CrossFill is based on a space-filling surface that employs spatially varying subdivision levels. Dithering of the subdivision levels is performed to accurately reproduce a prescribed density distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossFill on a number of experimental tests and applications."

A widely used practice to fabricate such models is by layer-based additive manufacturing (AM), which however suffers from the problem of adding and removing interior supporting structures. In this paper, we present a novel method for generating application-specific infill structures on rhombic cells so that the resultant structures can automatically satisfy manufacturing requirements on overhang-angle and wall-thickness. Additional supporting structures can be avoided entirely in our framework. To achieve this, we introduce the usage of an adaptive rhombic grid, which is built from an input surface model. Starting from the initial sparse set of rhombic cells, via numerical optimization techniques an objective function can be improved by adaptively subdividing the rhombic grid and thus adding more walls in cells. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for generating interior designs in the applications of improving mechanical stiffness and static stability."

This paper proposes a method for torch path planning applicable to SFF based on welding with an emphasis on minimum human intervention. The suggested approach describes a method based on the subdivision of a two-dimensional (2-D) polygonal section into a set of monotone polygons to generate a continuous path for material deposition. A two-dimensional contour is subdivided into smaller polygons (subpolygons). The path for each individual subpolygon is generated. The final torch path is obtained by connecting individual paths for all the subpolygons and trimming along the points of intersection of the paths for individual subpolygons. The final path is a closed loop; therefore, any point can be selected as the starting point for material deposition. The proposed method can be used to develop the toolpath for CNC milling."

This paper presents an integrated methodology for planning of tangential path velocity, material deposition rate and temperature control of the extruded material which is deposited along curved paths. The tangential velocity along the path is smoothed and optimized while respecting the heater’s and extruder’s capacities, as well as the feed drives’ jerk, acceleration and velocity limits. The extrusion rate is controlled proportional to the tangential path velocity while keeping the temperature of the deposited thermo-plastic material at the desired temperature by adaptively controlling current supply to the heater. The experimentally proven algorithm leads to more uniform material deposition at sharp curvatures and resulting improved dimensional accuracy of printed parts. The proposed methodology can be extended to laser and electron beam based metal printing applications."

This work explains how to use the interpolation options (linear, circular and Bezier) provided by an open source firmware, and defines an analytical and experimental procedure to compare those schemes by means of their speed profile."

The proposed approach aims to tackle the generation of direction-parallel tool-paths for the interior filling of simple connected areas, which comprises three main steps: (1) determining the inclination of reference lines; (2) generating and grouping tool-path segments into individual sub-paths; and (3) linking sub-paths based on specific requirements. These three modules interact to affect the efficiency and precision of AM significantly. In order to find an optimal inclination, we first analyze the impacts on the fabrication efficiency and manufacturing accuracy with different inclinations. A comparatively accurate building time model is developed subsequently to obtain the optimal tool-path inclination, but without compromising the machining precision, based on the analysis of a geometrical accuracy model. The proposed approach employs different inclinations in distinct layers according to specific manufacturing scenarios and technological requirements. After determining the reference lines, the tool-path segments are selected and grouped based on some characteristics (e.g., the number of intersections between reference lines and boundaries) to make up individual sub-paths, which are then connected to a zigzag-shaped path with short line segment connections. In the module for sub-path linking, some strategies are introduced to decrease the number of useless tool-paths, i.e., uncut paths, which could jeopardize the manufacturing quality by frequently turning the print head on and off. In addition, parametric curves are used to link the final sub-paths to avoid deceleration/acceleration processes in the end/starting parts of the sub-paths. The proposed approach has been used in practice to generate tool-paths for a wide range of models and the results verify its effectiveness and obvious advantages."

	abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a popular 3D printing process that has gained interest from industry in a wide range of applications. This research work studies directional properties of FFF 3D printed PLA specimens per ASTM D638-14. Tensile strength, modulus, and failure strain of specimens along and transverse to the printing direction are evaluated. It is observed that FFF 3D printing introduces anisotropic behavior to the manufactured part, e.g. tensile strength of 57.7 and 30.8 MPa for loading along and perpendicular to the printing direction, respectively. FFF 3D printers, like other automated manufacturing techniques, introduce defects into fabricated parts considering their tolerances, e.g. in the form of missing materials leading to gaps. This study investigates the impact of gaps on tensile strength, modulus, and failure strain of 3D printed parts. Compared with the baseline, 20.5\% reduction in tensile strength, 9.6\% in modulus, and 11.5\% in failure strain are observed due to missing extrudates (gaps) transverse to the loading direction. Experimental results from this study can be used as input data for Finite Element (FE) simulation and its verification.}
