volume="159",

pages="193--220",
abstract="A single-layer urban canopy model that captures sub-facet heterogeneity and various hydrological processes is further developed to explicitly incorporate trees within the urban canyon. The physical processes associated with trees are shortwave/longwave radiation exchange, including mutual interception and shading by trees and buildings and multiple reflections, sensible heat and latent heat (through transpiration) exchange, and root water uptake. A computationally-efficient geometric approach is applied to the radiation exchanges, requiring a priori knowledge of view factors. These view factors are first obtained from independent Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations, and subsequently simple relations, which are functions of canyon aspect ratio and tree-crown ratio, are proposed to estimate them. The developed model is evaluated against field observations at two urban sites and one suburban site, showing improved performance for latent heat flux compared to the previous version that only includes ground vegetation. The trees in the urban canopy act to considerably decrease sensible heat flux and increase latent heat flux, and these effects are found to be more significant in the more dense urban site. Sensitivity tests are then performed to examine the effects of tree geometry relative to canyon geometry. The results indicate that the tree-crown size relative to canyon width is the most influential parameter to decrease sensible heat flux and increase latent heat flux, resulting in cooling of the urban area.",

title="Guaranteed-Quality All-Quadrilateral Mesh Generation with Feature Preservation",
booktitle="Proceedings of the 18th International Meshing Roundtable",
year="2009",
publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
pages="45--63",
abstract="In this paper, a quadtree-based mesh generation method is described to create guaranteed-quality, geometry-adapted all-quadrilateral meshes with feature preservation for arbitrary planar domains. Given point cloud, our method generates all-quad meshes with these points as vertices and all the angles are within [45{\textdegree}, 135{\textdegree}]. For given planar curves, quadtree-based spatial decomposition is governed by the curvature of the boundaries and narrow regions. 2-refinement templates are chosen for local mesh refinement without creating any hanging nodes. A buffer zone is created by removing elements around the boundary. To guarantee the mesh quality, the angles facing the boundary are improved via template implementation, and two buffer layers are inserted in the buffer zone. It is proved that all the elements of the final mesh are quads with angles between 45{\textdegree}{\textpm}$\epsilon$ and 135{\textdegree}{\textpm}$\epsilon$ ($\epsilon${\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}5{\textdegree}) with the exception of badly shaped elements that may be required by the specified geometry. Sharp features and narrow regions are detected and preserved. Furthermore, boundary layer meshes are generated by splitting elements of the second buffer layer. We have applied our algorithm to a set of complicated geometries, including the Lake Superior map and the air foil with multiple components.",
